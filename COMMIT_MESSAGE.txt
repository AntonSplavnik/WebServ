fix: correct PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED handling for CGI requests

Fixed incorrect path calculation for CGI requests with PATH_INFO (e.g., 
/cgi-bin/script.py/extra/path). The issue was in how the script path 
and PATH_INFO were being split from the request path.

Changes in request_router.cpp:
- Fixed extension finding logic to locate extensions at the end of 
  filenames (followed by '/' or end of string), not just anywhere in 
  the path
- Improved path splitting to correctly separate script filename from 
  PATH_INFO portion
- Added comprehensive debug output for CGI routing to trace path 
  calculations
- Now correctly calculates:
  * scriptPart: "test_POST_GET.py" 
  * pathInfo: "/kek/lol"
  * scriptPath: absolute filesystem path to script

Changes in cgi_helpers.cpp:
- Fixed extractCgiExtension() to handle PATH_INFO cases
- Previously only matched paths ending with extension, now correctly 
  finds extensions at end of filenames even when followed by additional 
  path segments

Changes in cgi.cpp:
- Use pathInfo from RoutingResult instead of recalculating it
- Ensures consistency between request router and CGI environment setup
- Improved PATH_TRANSLATED calculation to use correct pathInfo value
- Added debug output for PATH_INFO, SCRIPT_NAME, and PATH_TRANSLATED
- PATH_TRANSLATED now correctly maps PATH_INFO to filesystem path using 
  document root

This fix ensures that CGI scripts receive correct PATH_INFO and 
PATH_TRANSLATED environment variables, allowing them to properly 
handle requests with additional path segments after the script name.
